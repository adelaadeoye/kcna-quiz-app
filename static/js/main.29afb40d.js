A Deployment provides declarative updates for Pods and ReplicaSets and is the recommended way to run scalable, stateless applications on a Kubernetes cluster. While a ReplicaSet ensures that a specified number of Pod replicas are running, Deployments offer additional features like rolling updates, rollback capabilities, and versioning. DaemonSets are used to run one Pod per node, and individual Pods are not suitable for scalable applications as they don\'t provide replication or management capabilities.

Its main purpose is to ensure that containers described in PodSpecs are running and healthy. The kubelet takes a set of PodSpecs provided through various mechanisms (primarily through the API server) and ensures the containers described in those PodSpecs are running. It manages Pod lifecycle, reports node and Pod status back to the API server, and handles container health checks. The kubelet doesn\'t manage containers that were not created by Kubernetes.

In Kubernetes, when no explicit authorization mode is configured, the default behavior is `--authorization-mode=AlwaysAllow`. This mode allows all requests without any authorization checks, which carries significant security risks. The documentation explicitly warns against using AlwaysAllow mode on clusters where you don\'t trust all potential API clients, especially those reachable from the public internet. In production environments, RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) is the recommended authorization mode for securing API access."},{"section":"KCNA Practice Test","number":5,"question":"these\\tjobs\\tmust\\tbe\\tcompleted\\tby\\tMonday\\tnight.\\tWhat\'s\\tgoing\\tto\\tbe\\tthe\\tmost\\tcost-effective\\tmethod?","options":["Run\\ta\\tgroup\\tof\\tnodes\\twith\\tthe\\texact\\trequired\\tsize\\tto\\tcomplete\\tthe\\tbatch\\ton\\ttime,\\tand\\tuse\\ta\\tcombination\\tof","taints,\\ttolerations,\\tand\\tnodeSelectors\\tto\\treserve\\tthese\\tnodes\\tto\\tthe\\tbatch\\tjobs.","Leverage\\tthe\\tKubernetes\\tCluster\\tAutoscaler\\tto\\tautomatically\\tstart\\tand\\tstop\\tnodes\\tas\\tthey\'re\\tneeded.","Commit\\tto\\ta\\tspecific\\tlevel\\tof\\tspending\\tto\\tget\\tdiscounted\\tprices\\t(with\\te.g.\\t\u201creserved\\tinstances\u201d\\tor\\tsimilar"],"answer":"B","explanation":"This is the correct answer for question 5."},{"section":"KCNA Practice Test","number":6,"question":"What\\tis\\ta\\tKubernetes\\tservice\\twith\\tno\\tcluster\\tIP\\taddress\\tcalled?","options":["Headless\\tService","Nodeless\\tService","IPLess\\tService","Specless\\tService"],"answer":"A","explanation":"Headless Service is the correct answer. A headless Service is a Kubernetes service with no cluster IP address, created by explicitly setting `.spec.clusterIP` to `\\"None\\"`. For headless Services, a cluster IP is not allocated, kube-proxy does not handle these services, and there is no load balancing or proxying done by the platform. Instead, headless Services allow clients to connect directly to individual Pods by reporting the endpoint IP addresses of the individual Pods via internal DNS records. This is useful for service discovery mechanisms and when you need direct Pod-to-Pod communication without going through a load balancer."},{"section":"KCNA Practice Test","number":7,"question":"What\\tdefault\\tlevel\\tof\\tprotection\\tis\\tapplied\\tto\\tthe\\tdata\\tin\\tSecrets\\tin\\tthe\\tKubernetes\\tAPI?","options":["The\\tvalues\\tuse\\tAES\\tSymmetric\\tEncryption","The\\tvalues\\tare\\tstored\\tin\\tplain\\ttext","The\\tvalues\\tare\\tencoded\\twith\\tSHA256\\thashes","The\\tvalues\\tare\\tbase64\\tencoded"],"answer":"D","explanation":"Base64 encoded is the correct answer. By default, values in Kubernetes Secrets are stored as base64 encoded strings, not as plain text or encrypted data. The documentation clearly states that \'values are base64 encoded, which obscures them but does NOT provide any useful level of confidentiality.\' This base64 encoding is only for data format consistency and is NOT a security measure. The data is actually stored unencrypted in etcd unless additional encryption at rest is explicitly configured.
